<h1>Use-Case and Interaction Flow</h1>
<p>Peter Piper has just sold half of his peck of peppers that he had picked and pickled.  He wants to update his Garden Connect post to reflect that he has less pickled peppers for sale now.</p>
<br>
<p>Precondition: Peter is not logged in to the Garden Connect web page. He has his email open to an email he just received from Garden Connect.</p>
<p>Post-condition: Peter's post is updated to reflect how many peppers he has.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Peter reads the email notifying him that it has been a week since his pickled pepper post and that it will be removed one month after posting.</li>
        <li>Peter clinks on the link to update his post, as he has not yet sold his entire peck of pickled peppers.</li>
        <li>Garden Connect tries to load the "my profile" page and redirects to the sign-in page.</li>
        <li>Peter inputs his email and password and clicks "sign-in."</li>
        <li>Garden Connect loads the "my profile" page.</li>
        <li>Peter clicks on the "edit" icon to edit the post.</li>
        <li>Garden Connect loads the input fields, allowing the post to be edited.</li>
        <li>Peter changes the "description" section to indicate the new amount available and clicks "Done."</li>
        <li>Garden Connect loads the "my profile" page, showing the new amount.</li>
        <li>Garden Connect updates the post in the "Harvest" section.</li>
    </ul>
