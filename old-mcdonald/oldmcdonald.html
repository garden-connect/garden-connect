<h1>Name:Old McDonald</h1>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Devices</h3>
    <li>McDonald has an up-to-date MacBook from 2018.</li>
    <li>McDonald uses a Google phone, the Pixel 4 edition</li>
    <h3>Proficiency</h3>
    <li>Mcdonald is proficient and competent with the technology he uses. He has used a number of other websites in the past to aid him in the success of his farm, ie. the Work Away site and the WWOF site. He uses his phone regularly to coordinate with volunteers and to sell or trade his produce.</li>
    <h3>Feelings on Technology</h3>
    <li>McDonald enjoys the technology that he uses because it makes his life easier regarding the farm. He also enjoys being able to look up information and solutions re: gardening. He is excited about the Garden Connect website because it will allow him to centralize his communication regarding the farm. He only spends the amount of time necessary using technology, it is not something he uses for entertainment. </li>
    <h3>Needs and Wants</h3>
    <li>McDonald wants a convenient way to seek help for, or offer produce from his farm.</li>
    <li>He is interested in finding out more about other gardens and homesteads around him.</li>
    <li>He also is seeking more community and people with common interests</li>
    <li>He is always making phone calls, sending e-mails, and text messages, which can get confusing, so he wants a centralized place to communicate with people and coordinate times, trades, etc.</li>
    <li>He is not interested in social media and does not want to engage in a platform that is a popularity contest.</li>
    <h3>User Story</h3>
    <li>As a competent but casual user, I want to connect with people in my area about farming, gardening, livestock, etc. and be able to both seek and offer help, trades, and products.</li>
    <h3>Use-Case and Interaction Flow</h3>
