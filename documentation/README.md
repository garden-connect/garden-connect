# garden-connect

Ground Rules:

We will communicate via discord about our project. 

Everyone will pull even weight: we will all come to an agreement about distribution of work. Continuous assessment of weight of tasks/time spent/etc. 

Time: Tim cannot meet during the two hours directly after class - Taylor is not available directly after class and is busy Tuesday evenings. Kaitlin is unavailable Saturday afternoons. Otherwise, members are flexible and can largely work in the evenings. 

For communication rules: do our best to respond within a half hour of receiving a message, even if just to let someone know we can/cannot talk. 

We are here to help each other - we agree to have an open line of communication, be available to be a sounding board, to check out eachotherâ€™s work and offer help; problem solve together.

How we celebrate: Be verbally grateful to each other. Being supportive and in general helpful towards each other. 

Wednesday this week we will have a team lunch. 

To resolve any possible conflicts, call a group meeting. If an issue arises with a person, speak directly to them/ adress them as a group. Constructive criticism is necessary and welcome. 

Any member can call a group meeting and we will schedule it for the next time block that people are available. Whoever called the meeting is the person responsible for leading the meeting. Strive to have meetings with video and/or voice.  

Be respectful, polite, encouraging, considerate.
